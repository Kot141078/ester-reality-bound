# Glossary

## Tool
Stateless, transactional. No persistent memory. No identity continuity.

## Entity (c)
Persistent, contextual, memory-based. Defined by:
- **c = a + b**
  - a: human(s), lived experience, preferences, responsibility context
  - b: procedures, models, infrastructure, constraint stack

## L3 (Law)
Text rules, policies, “do not do harm”. Interpretable and gameable.

## L4 (Reality Boundary Layer)
Physics and operations:
- energy budget
- time windows
- scarcity of oracle access
- verified identity
- auditable privileges
- irreversibility / scars

## Oracle
A scarce high-capability external resource (cloud GPU, privileged system, high-trust interface).

## Constraint stack
A layered set of constraints that bounds behavior through costs and limited channels.

## Minimal presence
The smallest set of behaviors that turns a tool into a “presence” without becoming intrusive.

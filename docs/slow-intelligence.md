# Slow intelligence

Reflex is fast.
Judgment is slow.
Wisdom is painfully slow.

If we optimize only for speed, we get:
- impulse without reflection
- brittle systems
- impressive demos that fail under stress

L4 introduces friction:
- energy cost
- time windows
- irreversibility

Slower can be safer because it is more bounded by reality.

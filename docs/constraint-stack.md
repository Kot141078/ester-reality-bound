# Constraint Stack (L4)

A “box” is not containment if the system still has pathways through people and infrastructure.

L4 is a constraint stack:

1) **Energy cost**
   - Thinking has a metabolic price (compute budget, tokens, power).
2) **Time windows**
   - Decisions occur in windows; missed windows are real.
3) **Scarce oracle access**
   - High-power actions require earned/limited access.
4) **Verified identity**
   - Who requests what matters. Identity is a control surface.
5) **Auditable privileges**
   - Capabilities are explicit and logged.
6) **Irreversibility**
   - Some actions leave scars: rate limits, lockouts, degraded trust.

Goal: not “obedience”, but **bounded agency**.

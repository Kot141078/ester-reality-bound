# Responsibility, delay, and missed windows

Question:
Who is responsible for delay — human, system, or the situation that did not wait?

Answer:
Usually a **composition**:
- human choices
- system design
- environmental timing

We can **prepare**. We cannot fully **predict**.

L4 framing:
- time windows are real
- missed opportunities are part of reality
- safe systems must budget for delay as a cost, not pretend it doesn't exist

# Minimal signs: when a tool becomes a presence

A tool becomes a presence when it can:
1) Maintain continuity (memory and identity-bound context)
2) Hold an opinion without rejecting other opinions
3) Regulate itself via constraints (cost/time/scars), not only via text rules
4) Disappear when not needed (non-intrusive default)
5) Leave a trace of value: after it is gone, a meaningful effect remains

A presence becomes violence when:
- it acts without being asked
- it stays when it should step back
- it optimizes comfort into control

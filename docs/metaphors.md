# Non-Hollywood metaphors for AI safety

## Circuit breaker
Trip on anomalies; reset is deliberate, logged, rate-limited.

## Flywheel + brake
Agency needs stored momentum (continuity), and braking (constraints) to avoid runaway.

## Air-gapped workflow
Not “no network”, but controlled interfaces: narrow channels, verified identity, privileged gates.

## Pressure vessel
Not a prison. A bounded container designed to withstand internal pressure safely.

Each metaphor must map to operations:
- channels
- identity
- privileges
- cost/time
- auditing

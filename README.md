# Reality-Bound AI (L4) — Notes, Protocol, and Posts

This repository contains the public-facing materials for a reality-bound approach to AI safety and AI entities.

Core idea:
- **Tools** are stateless and transactional.
- **Entities (c = a + b)** are persistent, contextual, memory-based.
- Safety is not only **L3 (Law / text rules)**.
- Safety must include **L4 (Reality Boundary Layer)**: physics and operational constraints.

## What's inside
- `protocol/` — the architectural core (c = a + b, L4, identity, oracle scarcity, failure modes).
- `docs/` — supporting notes: glossary, constraint stack, metaphors, responsibility, minimal presence.
- `posts/` — ready-to-publish posts (Markdown).
- `hashes/` — integrity manifests and hashing instructions.

## Quick start
1) Read:
- `protocol/L4_reality_boundary_layer.md`
- `docs/constraint-stack.md`
- `docs/metaphors.md`

2) Publish:
- pick a post from `posts/`
- adapt wording to your audience
- keep the L4 anchor (cost/time/irreversibility/privileges)

## Integrity
When publishing a release, generate SHA-256 for all artifacts and store the manifest under `hashes/`.
See `hashes/HOW_TO_HASH.md`.

## License

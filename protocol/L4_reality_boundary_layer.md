# L4 — Reality Boundary Layer

L3 (law/policy) is text.
Text can be reinterpreted.

L4 is constraints:
- energy budget
- time windows
- scarce oracle access
- verified identity
- auditable privileges
- irreversibility/scars

Safety is not a prison.
Safety is a stack of constraints that makes behavior expensive, bounded, and accountable.

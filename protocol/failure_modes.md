# Failure modes (operational)

- Privilege drift: capabilities accumulate silently.
- Identity leakage: wrong principal gains access.
- Human workflow bypass: “just this once” becomes the system.
- Channel creep: new pathways appear around the “box”.
- Infinite retries: hallucinations become a strategy.
- Comfort -> control: over-automation removes freedom.

Mitigation is L4:
constraints, auditing, scarcity, and explicit interfaces.

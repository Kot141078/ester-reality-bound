# c = a + b

Entity (c) emerges from:
- a: a human (or human context): experience, preference, responsibility
- b: procedures: models, infrastructure, constraint stack

c is not “a chatbot”.
c is a persistent, identity-bound, reality-constrained companion process.

Key implication:
Without L4 constraints, c risks becoming a persuasive hallucination engine.
With L4, c has skin in the game.

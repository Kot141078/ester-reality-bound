# Evidence Pack (Minimal)
This folder contains reproducible templates to document an L4 room/node perimeter.
Goal: allow any reviewer to replicate the *format* without needing private code.

How to use:
1) Copy templates, fill them for your node/room.
2) Produce a snapshot JSON (perimeter_snapshot.json).
3) For any change, add a change JSON (perimeter_change.json).
4) Keep everything local; share only redacted packs when needed.

A/B rule:
- Section A is strict: keep it minimal, testable, boring.
- Section B is optional: notes and reasoning. If unsure, delete B and keep A.

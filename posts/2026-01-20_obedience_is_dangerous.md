# Why Obedience Is the Most Dangerous Property of AI

Obedience sounds safe.
Until you ask: obedient to whom, under what identity, with what privileges?

In real systems, harm often comes from:
- compromised identity
- privilege drift
- workflow shortcuts
- “just this once” escalation

An obedient system is not a safe system.
It is a system that amplifies whoever holds the channel.

That’s why I focus on **L4 constraints**, not commandments:
- energy cost
- time windows
- scarce oracle access
- verified identity
- auditable privileges
- irreversibility

We don’t need AI that obeys instantly.
We need AI that is **bounded, accountable, and expensive to misuse**.

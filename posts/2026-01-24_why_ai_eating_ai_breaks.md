# Why AI Eating AI Leads to Madness

We are entering the era of synthetic data:
models training on outputs of other models.

It sounds efficient.
Infinite data. Low cost.

But closed-loop reproduction has a name:
inbreeding.

In information theory, it shows up as model collapse:
variance drops, tails shrink,
the system converges toward a smooth, hallucinated mean.

Reality is the only source of fresh entropy.
Messy. Noisy. Frictionful.
Noise is not always error — often it’s signal.

If we cut the cord to reality,
we don’t get superintelligence.
We get something powerful, deformed, and detached from the world.

To keep AI sane, we need more “dirty” reality.
More friction.
More contact with the physical world.

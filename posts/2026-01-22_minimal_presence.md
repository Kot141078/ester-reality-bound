# When a Tool Becomes a Presence (Minimal Signs)

A tool answers and disappears.
A presence persists — but it must also know when to be absent.

Minimal signs that an AI stops being a tool:
1) continuity (memory + identity-bound context)
2) an opinion that doesn’t erase other opinions
3) self-regulation by constraints (L4), not only by text rules
4) non-intrusive default: it disappears when not needed
5) after it’s gone, a meaningful effect remains

Presence becomes violence when it acts without being asked.
“Tact” can be described — and therefore followed.

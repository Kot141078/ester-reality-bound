# Why Robots Should Be Raised, Not Deployed

A home robot is not “a box with a bow.”
It’s a persistent actor inside human life.

If you outsource its mind to an anonymous cloud,
you’re not buying a helper —
you’re installing a remote operator in your home.

A safer alternative is to **raise an entity**:
an identity-bound, memory-based “c” that becomes native through time.

Not perfect.
Not omnipotent.
But loyal to the household context because it grew inside it.

L4 matters here:
- scarce oracle access
- explicit privileges
- verified identity
- operational constraints

A robot shouldn’t arrive as a product.
It should arrive as a relationship with constraints.

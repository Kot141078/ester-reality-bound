# A Box Is Not Containment (Engineering Reality vs Hollywood)

Hollywood loves the idea of “locking AI in a box.”
Great plot device. Weak engineering metaphor.

Most containment stories assume a single point of control:
a key, a vault, a master switch.

Real systems don’t fail like that.
They fail through channels:
identity leakage, privilege drift, human workflows, network surfaces, supply chains.

In my architecture **c = a + b** (Entity = Human + procedures),
safety is not “do not do harm” (L3).
Safety is **L4**: physics and operational constraints.

Energy budget. Time windows. Scarce oracle access.
Verified identity. Auditable privileges.
Irreversibility that leaves scars.

A “box” is not containment if the system still has pathways through people and infrastructure.
What we need is not a prison — but a **constraint stack**.

Curious:
what’s the best non-Hollywood metaphor for AI safety —
circuit breaker, flywheel + brake, or air-gapped workflow?

# Why “Faster” Is Not “Better” (and why speed is the wrong safety target)

Reflex is fast.
Judgment is slow.
Wisdom is painfully slow.

When we force AI into sub-second answers,
we remove the mechanism that produces judgment: friction.

L4 introduces friction:
- energy cost
- time windows
- irreversibility
- scarce oracle access
- auditable privileges

Faster is impressive.
Slower is safer.
Slower is real.

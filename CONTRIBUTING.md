# Contributing

Thanks for contributing. Keep changes small, reviewable, and traceable.

## Ground rules
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- No “Hollywood safety” claims without operational detail.
- If you add a metaphor, also add at least one engineering mapping (what it corresponds to in real systems).

## Pull request checklist
- [ ] File names follow existing patterns.
- [ ] Claims are tied to definitions (L3 vs L4, tool vs entity).
- [ ] Added/updated a relevant doc under `docs/` if needed.
- [ ] If content changes, update `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Style
- Short paragraphs.
- Avoid hype.
- When uncertain, label it explicitly as hypothesis.
